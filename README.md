# **LiveCam AI â€“ Real-Time Object Detection & Motion Tracking**

LiveCam AI is a real-time video streaming and AI-powered object detection system using **Flask, OpenCV, and YOLOv5**. It detects motion, identifies objects, and records videos with detected events. Designed for **surveillance and smart monitoring**, it features a web-based interface for live streaming, motion tracking, and recording control. ðŸš€

## **Features**
âœ… **Real-Time Video Streaming** â€“ Streams video from an IP or mobile camera.  
âœ… **AI Object Detection** â€“ Uses YOLOv5 to detect objects in real-time.  
âœ… **Motion Tracking** â€“ Highlights moving objects with bounding boxes.  
âœ… **Automatic Recording** â€“ Saves videos when motion is detected.  
âœ… **Recording Timer** â€“ Displays elapsed recording time.  
âœ… **Web-Based Interface** â€“ Control and monitor the stream via a browser.  

## **Tech Stack**
- **Flask** (Python) â€“ Web framework
- **OpenCV** â€“ Image processing
- **YOLOv5** â€“ Object detection model
- **Torch (PyTorch)** â€“ Deep learning backend
- **HTML/CSS/JS** â€“ Frontend for the web interface

## **Installation & Setup**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/livecam-ai.git
cd livecam-ai
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
